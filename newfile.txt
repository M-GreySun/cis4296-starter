Hi, Marcie! We're just writing something quick so that we can
say that we edited/ made changes to said file.

This is the first change in this file
This is just for some extra practice.

This is the second change in this file.
This time instead of yes or "y" I'll answer
"n" or no.

I didn't stage the other section that was
add and therefor no changes were made.
I think I got the hang of it a little.
